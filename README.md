# Energy-optimization
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely used in smart cities, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation. However, their efficiency is limited by battery life and energy consumption. This project proposes an energy-efficient WSN model integrating:

-Multi-hop communication using a modified Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
-Adaptive clustering through reinforcement learning
By optimizing data transmission and cluster head selection, this approach extends network lifetime, reduces energy consumption, and improves network reliability.
