# Energy-optimization
# Project Goals
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely used in smart cities, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation. However, their efficiency is limited by battery life and energy consumption. This project proposes an energy-efficient WSN model integrating:

- Multi-hop communication using a modified Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
- Adaptive clustering through reinforcement learning.
By optimizing data transmission and cluster head selection, this approach extends network lifetime, reduces energy consumption, and improves network reliability.
# Technologies Used
- Programming: Python, MATLAB
- Machine Learning: Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning
- Network Algorithms: Modified Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Simulation: Energy-aware simulations with randomly distributed sensor nodes

# Key Features

- Adaptive Clustering with Machine Learning – Dynamically selects cluster heads based on energy levels, node density, and distance to base station.
- Reinforcement Learning-based Optimization – Ensures efficient energy balancing for longer network lifetime.
- Fault-Tolerant Network Design – Nodes adapt to failures and energy constraints dynamically.
- Simulation-Based Performance Evaluation – Metrics include energy consumption, throughput, and network longevity.
