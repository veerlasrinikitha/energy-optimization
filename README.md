# Energy-optimization
# Project Goals
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely used in smart cities, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation. However, their efficiency is limited by battery life and energy consumption. This project proposes an energy-efficient WSN model integrating:

- Multi-hop communication using a modified Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
- Adaptive clustering through reinforcement learning.
By optimizing data transmission and cluster head selection, this approach extends network lifetime, reduces energy consumption, and improves network reliability.
# Technologies Used
- Programming: Python, MATLAB
- Machine Learning: Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning
- Network Algorithms: Modified Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Simulation: Energy-aware simulations with randomly distributed sensor nodes

# Dependencies and Setup

- torch and torch-geometric (for building and training GNN models)
- numpy, pandas (for data manipulation)
- scikit-learn (for preprocessing and evaluation metrics)
- matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)
- networkx (for graph construction and analysis)
